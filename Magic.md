Aetheria is a land steeped in magical energies, where the arcane arts are practiced by many. Magic is categorized into various schools, each with its own focus and methods. Mages, sorcerers, clerics, and other magic users often specialize in one or more schools of magic, honing their skills to manipulate the forces of the world around them. Many people will be skilled in general magic. Mages generally learn basic spells from multiple schools, but tend to specialize in one or two and may be unable to use spells from schools opposed to their specialtys. Those specialized in more than two schools are rare and often viewed with suspicion or awe.

## Basic Spells

### General
General spells are a catch-all term for those that can be learned by most magic users even those who lack the power to become true mages. These spells form the foundation of magical knowledge and are often taught to novice mages. People with low magical ability who can only use cantrips are often referred to as hedge magicians.

The only spell in this category is cantrip which is a minor magical effect that can be performed by almost anyone with a small amount of magical ability. Examples include creating a small light, conjuring/summoning small objects of low value, cleaning, or producing a simple sound. These effects are generally limited in scope and power. It is primarily used for utility, minor convenience, or dramatic effect, but has little to no combat application.

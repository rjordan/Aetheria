        <h1>Alignment and Character Profile System</h1>
<p>Aetheria uses a profile system to define the core behavior of individuals, species, and groups. The system relies on four axes that define an entity's Beliefs, Morals, Actions, and Expression.</p>
<h1>The Four-Axis Master Character Profile</h1>
<p>Every entity is defined by four core axes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideology¬†(Modifier)</li>
<li>Morality¬†(Modifier)</li>
<li>Methodology¬†(Modifier)</li>
<li>Temperament¬†(Distribution)</li>
</ul>

</table>
<h3>Note: Temperament is generally not modified. The value is the core expression. For groups, use the Varies (Primary) or Varies (Primary/Secondary) format.</h3>
<h3>Guidelines for Entity Templates vs. Individuals</h3>
<p>The generic template for a species or group (e.g., &quot;Elf,&quot; &quot;Goblin Tribe&quot;) represents the cultural and statistical tendency of that entity on all four axes.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Dynamic</th>
<th>Action</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Individual</td>
<td>Override the Template</td>
<td>The individual profile for a named character always overrides the group's generic template. A single dark elf can be Good even if the species template is Evil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Groups</td>
<td>Template as Probability</td>
<td>Defined by a Tendency indicating the group's most common emotional makeup. Format: Varies (Primary/Secondary) or Varies (Primary). This defines the average group vibe, not internal hierarchy. When generating a random NPC from a generic template, the AI should use the listed values as the highest probability choice. For a &quot;Good&quot; species, a random individual is most likely to be Good.</td>

  &quot;Temperament&quot;: &quot;Varies (Fire/Other, Fire is Dominant)&quot;,
  &quot;Description&quot;: &quot;A chaotic tribe of goblins that live for the thrill of the hunt and the spoils of battle. They have no allegiance to any higher power or structure, and their actions are driven by immediate needs and desires. Their temperament varies, but they tend to be impulsive and quick to anger, often acting on instinct rather than careful planning. The tribe is volatile with Fire types bullying the rest into following their lead, the actual hunting/spying is done by cunning Water types, while the easily bullied Earth types make up the expendable ground troops. Air types tend to be shamans or mages and are slightly more respected/feared. Aether types are rare and generally used as fodder or slave labor.&quot;,

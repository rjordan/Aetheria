        <h1>The World of Aetheria</h1>
<p>This is the definitive Resource Guide, designed to provide clear, actionable instructions for generating character and group behavior in the Aetheria setting.</p>
<p>This work draws inspiration from classic fantasy settings, blending traditional elements with unique twists to create a rich and immersive environment. Particular influences include Tabletop RPGs, Isekai anime, and popular literature.</p>
<p>Planned feautures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A full world setting with geography, history, cultures, and factions.</li>
<li>A comprehensive bestiary of creatures</li>
<li>Detailed character classes and professions</li>
<li>An extensive equipment catalog</li>
<li>A robust magic system</li>
<li>A complex political landscape</li>
<li>An MCP server to allow AI agents to utilize these resources in real-time storytelling.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>The <a href="docs/Classes.md">Classes</a> document outlines the various character classes available in Aetheria, each with unique abilities, skills, and roles. This section is essential for understanding how different characters can contribute to the story and interact with the world.</p>
<h2>Alignment</h2>
<p><a href="docs/Alignment.md">Alignment</a> is a system based on four axes: Ideology, Morality, Methodology, and Temperament. Each axis has specific values that define the behavior and personality of entities within the narrative. Many systems are reducing or replacing traditional alignment systems (such as D&amp;D's Lawful/Chaotic and Good/Evil) but these concepts are needed to allow an AI to generate consistent and believable behavior for characters and groups.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>The <a href="docs/Equipment.md">Equipment</a> document provides detailed information on the various types of weapons, armor, accessories, and tools available in Aetheria. No character is restricted to any particular equipment based on class, but certain classes may have proficiencies or special abilities that enhance their use of specific items.</p>
<h2>Magic</h2>
<p>The <a href="docs/Magic.md">Magic</a> document details the magical systems, spells, and schools of magic in Aetheria. Magic is a powerful force that can shape the world and influence events, and understanding its mechanics is crucial for characters who wield it.</p>
<h2>Politics</h2>
<p>The <a href="docs/Politics.md">Politics</a> document explores the diverse political systems, ranks, and notable governments in Aetheria. Politics plays a significant role in shaping the world and the interactions between characters, factions, and nations. Understanding the political landscape is essential for navigating the complexities of Aetherian society and for creating compelling narratives involving power struggles, alliances, and conflicts.</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>The <a href="docs/Religion.md">Religion</a> document delves into the various belief systems, deities, and religious practices in Aetheria. Religion influences many aspects of life, from personal values to societal structures, and understanding its role is vital for creating rich, immersive stories.</p>

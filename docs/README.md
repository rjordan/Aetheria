- A complex political landscape
- An MCP server to allow AI agents to utilize these resources in real-time storytelling.

## Classes
The [Classes](docs/Classes.md) document outlines the various character classes available in Aetheria, each with unique abilities, skills, and roles. This section is essential for understanding how different characters can contribute to the story and interact with the world.

## Alignment
[Alignment](docs/Alignment.md) is a system based on four axes: Ideology, Morality, Methodology, and Temperament. Each axis has specific values that define the behavior and personality of entities within the narrative. Many systems are reducing or replacing traditional alignment systems (such as D&D's Lawful/Chaotic and Good/Evil) but these concepts are needed to allow an AI to generate consistent and believable behavior for characters and groups.

## Equipment
The [Equipment](docs/Equipment.md) document provides detailed information on the various types of weapons, armor, accessories, and tools available in Aetheria. No character is restricted to any particular equipment based on class, but certain classes may have proficiencies or special abilities that enhance their use of specific items.

## Magic
The [Magic](docs/Magic.md) document details the magical systems, spells, and schools of magic in Aetheria. Magic is a powerful force that can shape the world and influence events, and understanding its mechanics is crucial for characters who wield it.

## Politics
The [Politics](docs/Politics.md) document explores the diverse political systems, ranks, and notable governments in Aetheria. Politics plays a significant role in shaping the world and the interactions between characters, factions, and nations. Understanding the political landscape is essential for navigating the complexities of Aetherian society and for creating compelling narratives involving power struggles, alliances, and conflicts.

## Religion
The [Religion](docs/Religion.md) document delves into the various belief systems, deities, and religious practices in Aetheria. Religion influences many aspects of life, from personal values to societal structures, and understanding its role is vital for creating rich, immersive stories.

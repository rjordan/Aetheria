# How to Create a Character

First consider how this character fits into the world. Is it a simple villager who is just for background or a simple conversation? If so a simple race and gender maybe age and short description. If a minor NPC expand that with a longer more detailed description, probably a class and a couple personality traits. Is to be an ongoing character or NPC party member then a race, class, age, personality traits, relationships, and backstory are important.

## Steps to Create Your Character

1. Determine the character's role in the story (hero, villain, or background)
2. Select a race (consider racial distribution by region)
3. Pick an archetype (optional)
4. Choose or pick a gender. In general it should be a pretty even split for most races.
5. Decide on a class
6. Determine age and appearance
7. Finalize Alignment
8. Add personality traits
9. Establish relationships
10. Create a backstory
